ðŸš€ Welcome to the MUI Auto Form Dialog (AFD) project! The goal of this project is to simplify the creation of form dialogs using Material-UI (MUI) components.

## Project Overview
**MUI Auto Form Dialog (AFD)** is a React component that automates the process of building form dialogs through a JSON configuration. Say goodbye to manually coding UI components or wrestling with complex styling â€“ AFD takes care of it all. This component streamlines your workflow, enabling you to focus on defining your form's structure and data requirements.

## Key Advantages
- **Low-Code Approach:** AFD uses a modular JSON configuration to generate clean and polished Form Dialogs every time without exhaustive coding.
- **Simplified UI Creation:** Seamlessly generates Material-UI components based on your JSON configuration, streamlining the UI assembly process.
- **Automatic CSS Styling:** AFD handles CSS styling automatically, guaranteeing uniformity and responsiveness across your UI design.
Seamless
- **API Integration:** AFD uses Axios to send HTTP requests. The query and request type get defined from the values in the JSON configuration.
